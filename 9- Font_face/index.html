          React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS
          applications using React and the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With
          React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs as
          well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React
          components:
          <span class="italic">bundles of reusable, nestable code.</span> You
          can learn more about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover
          how components work in React Native.

          React Native runs on <span class="underline">React</span>, a popular
          open source library for building user interfaces with JavaScript. To
          make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself.
          This section can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.

          We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:
        </div>
        <div class="container-text5">
          <b>+ components.</b> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats
          in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need names and
          a cafe to work in.
        </div>
        <div class="container-text6">
          <b>+ JSX.</b> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you
          write elements inside JavaScript like so: &lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your
          cat!&lt;/Text&gt;.
        </div>
        <div class="container-text7">
          The React docs have
          <span class="underline">a comprehensive guide to JSX</span> you can
          refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use
          variables inside it. Here you are declaring a name for the cat, name,
          and embedding it with curly braces inside &lt;Text&gt;
        </div>
        <div class="container-text8">
          <b>+ props.</b> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.
        </div>
        <div class="container-text9">
          <b>+ state.</b> While you can think of props as arguments you use to
          configure how components render, state is like a component‚Äôs personal
          data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time
          or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components
          memory!

        <div class="container-text10">
          TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It
          has an <span class="italic">onChangeText</span> prop that takes a
          function to be called every time the text changed, and an
          onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be called when the text
          is submitted.
        </div>
        <div class="container-text11">
          For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating
          their words into a different language. In this new language, every
          single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there
          Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".
